                <p>Hi, I’m Julius Seltenheim — Engineering Lead, Architect, and Senior Fullstack Developer with over a decade of experience turning complex
                    ideas into elegant, scalable software. From cloud-native systems and microservices to high-performance frontends, I bring both
                    strategic vision and hands-on expertise to every project.</p>

                <p>Whether you’re a startup building from scratch or an enterprise optimizing mission-critical systems, I help teams deliver with
                    confidence, clarity, and speed. With a strong foundation in Java, Python, and TypeScript, I’ve led engineering teams across industries
                    — from public sector apps to media platforms and SaaS tools — always focusing on clean architecture, agile processes, and long-term
                    maintainability.</p>

                <p>Let’s build something great together.</p>

                            It was an absolute pleasure working with Julius over the past four months. He joined our cross-functional team, collaborating
                            with our partner in the public sector to build a React and Python-based web application. Julius seamlessly stepped in to cover
                            for a colleague on parental leave and quickly became an integral part of the team.</p>

                        <p class="card-text text-muted fst-italic">Julius took on the role of leading the development team, excelling in areas such as
                            full-stack development, stakeholder
                            communication, and feature preparation. His energy, initiative, and expertise were invaluable, driving significant improvements
                            to the project's structure and code quality.</p>

                        <p class="card-text text-muted fst-italic">The team’s feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and I wouldn’t hesitate to work with
                            him again in the future.</p>
                        <p class="card-text text-muted fst-italic">Thank you, Julius, for your outstanding contributions!</p>

                        <p class="card-text text-muted fst-italic">Julius worked with us on a project to improve our video rendering system architecture.
                            He led the efforts as the technical lead
                            of a small team of developers. Over the span of 4 months he was able to identify issues and bottlenecks of the previous system,
                            design an new architecture, plan the project and implement many crucial parts of the new architecture.</p>
                        <p class="card-text text-muted fst-italic">Through his fullstack expertise he was able to both direct and execute the backend
                            efforts as well as implement the frontend
                            tasks himself, as he was the only developer on the team with relevant frontend knowledge.</p>
                        <p class="card-text text-muted fst-italic">It was a pleasure working with him and seeing the project coming to live in time and
                            budget. The feedback from his team was
                            extremely positive and his work will have a lasting effect on our product.</p>

                        <p class="card-text text-muted fst-italic">Julius, thank you so much, we hope to work again with you soon.</p>
